            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I am a dedicated finance and accounting student at <strong>Corvinus University Budapest</strong>, currently expanding my skillset through participation in a <strong>Vibe coding course</strong>. Growing up in a large, loving family with many siblings and a variety of animals (including sheep!), I've developed a deep appreciation for nature, animals, and the balance between work and personal life. My passion for numbers and business is complemented by my love for the outdoors and my dreams of combining my accounting expertise with agritourism or tourism ventures.</p>
